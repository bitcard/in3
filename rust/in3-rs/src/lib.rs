//! Bindings to the [Incubed](https://github.com/slockit/in3-c/) C library.
//!
//! This crate is a wrapper around the
//! [Incubed](https://github.com/slockit/in3-c/) C library."
//!
//! The IN3 client is a
//! * Crypto-Economic
//! * Non-syncronizing and stateless, but fully verifying
//! * Minimal resource consuming
//!
//! blockchain client (Crypto-Economic Client, Minimal Verification Client, Ultra Light Client).
//!
//! The [`Client`](in3/struct.Client.html) struct is the main interface to the library.
